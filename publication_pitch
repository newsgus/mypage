 	<H1>Publication Pitch: Fútbol Soccer</H1>
 	
 	<h2>What is the idea for a publication?</h2>
 	<br>The idea is to create a community around everything fútbol for an audience that has grown watching, eating, dreaming, eating, and living fútbol... I mean, soccer here in the United States.</br>
 	

 	<h2>Who is your audience?</h2>
 	<br>My audience is every person who is passionate about fútbol soccer here in the States and everywhere else. I want to serve them the sport from as many angles as possible and take them beyond the sport itself. 

 	<h2>Is there a similar publication? If yes, how will your publication differentiate itself from the existing publication?</h2>
 	<p>I can think of a couple that kind of do that, goal.com or howler.com. Yet, they don't really go to where I'm leading. Goal deals with every score and news piece there is, while Howler is creating a culture around the sport. Fútbol Soccer is already a culture where the goals are understood as part of the game, but not as the game itself.</p>

 	<p>Fútbol Soccer would address the sport as the people in other parts of the world have experienced it for decades. It'd give it the relevance that still today is neglected in mainstream outlets. It's going to be a publication that, also, would create a venue for the people who have lived the sport to create content that speaks to their fútbol soccer experience. It would be created by brown people talking to brown people, those who made the sport relevant in this country but remain voiceless in this party.</p>

 	<h2>Give a few general examples of pieces that might run on this site.</h2>
 	<p>A piece I wrote last year about a small Chilean team with an entire country following them from the other side of the world: <a href="https://mojadocitizen.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/palestino-chile-palestine-futbol-libertadores/">Palestino</a>  
 	<p>Also last year, Remezcla took a little from the late and great Uruguayan writer, Eduardo Galeano, to run this great piece on the fútbol politics behind each of the teams playing in <a href="http://remezcla.com/features/the-open-veins-of-copa-america-2/">Copa América</a>.
